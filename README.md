##DESCRIPTION : This Jupyter Notebook builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The workflow includes:

Importing Libraries: Loads essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Data Loading: Reads the dataset from a CSV file located on the local system.

Data Cleaning: Replaces invalid zero values in key medical columns (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI) with median values.

Feature Scaling: Normalizes input features using StandardScaler.

Train-Test Split: Splits the data into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain class balance.

Model Building & Evaluation (implied in later cells): The model will likely involve training a DecisionTreeClassifier, visualizing the tree, and evaluating its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
